      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        We are a company that has been operating since 2017. We had the vision that the world is increasingly busy and time is now worth more than money. As we are a company passionate about automobiles, we could not realize that cars were no longer being treated correctly, due to the owner's lack of time to carry out maintenance. Therefore, we have created the means so that this problem can be resolved and the customer can have their car in the best condition again, without necessarily spending hours on end in queues at workshops.
        Thiagocar is modern, thinks about the customer and we do what we like. Many customers are already accustomed to this modality and do not want to lose this convenience. We are always available to carry out repairs on your vehicle, in the comfort of wherever the customer is.
        Our mission is to serve you effectively, with the best tools for an accurate and quick diagnosis. Bring more security to the customer who follows the diagnosis and service, as transparency is our objective.
