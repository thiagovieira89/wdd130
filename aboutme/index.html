    <p>Hello everyone, it's a pleasure for me to be here with you. I'm from the Northeast of Brazil, today I'm an automotive technician.I have been married about 10 years with my wonderful wife, Fernanda and we have 2 children, the oldest has 8 years old and the youngest 6 years old, we were blessed with 2 boys! I have been a member of the Church since my 6 years old, so I am a member about 28 years that I decided to follow Jesus Christ.
    I love my field, but I need to keep up with technology to continue growing, and one day I intend to be a developer in the automotive field! 
    As a freshman on campus and as a developer, I will be asking for your help a lot, so please be patient with me!</p>
